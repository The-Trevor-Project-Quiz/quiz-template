    Pride is our opportunity to reflect and celebrate how far the LGBTQ
    community has come since the Stonewall Uprising. But this year, due to the
    realities of COVID-19 pandemic, Pride won't look the same. Pride 2020 is
    certainly historic because it’s the first year many of us are primarily
    celebrating online. 


    We’re looking at the history of Pride to honor this year’s historic moment.

            During its first Pride, the rainbow flag had 8 colors. Once the flag
            needed to be mass produced, the designer Gilbert Baker had to remove
            the pink and turquoise stripes due to production concerns around
            color availability. Now the modern rainbow flag flies 6 colors —
            red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet — each color with their
            own significance to represent the diversity of the LGBTQ community.

            In the 1990s, Black Pride events started organizing in partnership
            with other Pride events throughout the U.S. But the very first
            official Black Pride event was at a popular black gay bar in
            Washington, D.C., the Club House. Since then, Pride events and
            parades for the Black community have been organized and promoted by
            the Center for Black Equality. Some of the most famous Black Pride

            After a series of complaints against LGBTQ bars in Philadelphia, the
            city wanted more representation of queer people of color in their
            community and pushed to add black and brown stripes to the
            traditional Pride flag. In 2017, the new 8-stripe flag was raised
            above City Hall in downtown Philadelphia. These stripes are a
            necessary adjustment to the traditional Pride flag to recognize and
            honor the people of color who started the LGBTQ equality movement
            and to represent queer people of color who are marginalized to this
            day. 


            The Trevor Project formally recognizes the 8-stripe inclusive Pride
            flag design as the official Pride flag.

        The updated Pride flag design includes two new stripes — black and
        brown. This revision to the original design was released in 2017 to
        represent the people of color who are vital to the LGBTQ movement —
        pioneers such as Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson who were both at
        the Stonewall Uprising in 1969.
