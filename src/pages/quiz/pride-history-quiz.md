    Pride was born from an uprising by LGBTQ protesters, including Black and
    Brown transgender women. The Stonewall Uprising was where our modern-day
    Pride parades began in New York City. Today, Pride is a time to honor our
    history and recognize how far we’ve come — and how far we have to go.

  intro: >-
    For many, this year’s Pride looks very different. On June 1, a day that
    ordinarily kicks off celebrations in LGBTQ communities worldwide, we found
    ourselves at the confluence of multiple mounting tragedies.


    Pride was born from an uprising by LGBTQ protesters, including Black and
    Brown transgender women. The Stonewall Uprising was where our modern-day
    Pride parades began in New York City. Today, Pride is a time to honor our
    history and recognize how far we’ve come — and how far we have to go.

        correctanswer:
          description: >-
            The 1960s and previous decades were not as welcoming for LGBTQ
            folks. The LGBTQ community found refuge in bars and clubs where they
            could be themselves and freely express their identities. Police
            often raided these sanctuaries, under the guise of the
            “three-article rule*,”  and violent clashes became more regular for
            the LGBTQ community.


            Then one night, New York City police raided the Stonewall Inn in
            Greenwich Village. This raid roughly hauled employees and patrons
            out of the bar and into the streets, arresting some patrons. This
            served as the catalyst for six days of protests and violent
            confrontation with police outside the bar on Christopher Street.


            The police violence and brutality against LGBTQ bar patrons and
            residents of Greenwich Village sparked the beginning of the
            Stonewall Uprising.

        correctanswer:
          description: >-
            On the morning of June 28, 1969, NYPD raided the Stonewall Inn. This
            sparked the Stonewall Uprising lasting six days. 


            One year after the Stonewall Uprising, thousands of New Yorkers
            gathered and marched from Greenwich Village to Central Park. It was
            then known as Christopher Street Liberation Day (CSLD). Since then,
            this march is still done, but it’s more recently known as the Pride
            Parade each year. 


            In 2019, we honored the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising
            and World Pride in New York City. The Trevor Project was named as a
            Grand Marshal for World Pride last year to celebrate the milestone
            anniversary and the LGBTQ youth we support every day.

            There are many stories and retellings of the events that occurred at
            Stonewall on the morning of June 28. The stories have shaped into
            Marsha P. Johnson being the first to throw a brick at the uprising.
            Marsha’s advocacy and passion for LGBTQ rights have influenced this
            story some but in an interview in 1987, Marsha revealed that she
            attended the uprising at Christopher Street after “the riots had
            already started.”


            Marsha P. Johnson is an icon and pioneering leader for Stonewall and
            for Pride everywhere, but contrary to popular belief, she did not
            throw the first brick.

            After a series of complaints against LGBTQ bars in Philadelphia, the
            city wanted more representation of queer people of color in their

        The updated Pride flag design includes two new stripes — black and
        brown. This revision to the original design was released in 2017 to
        represent the people of color who are vital to the LGBTQ movement —
        pioneers such as Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson who were both at
        the Stonewall Uprising in 1969.

    Thank you for taking the time to learn more about the history of Pride with
    us. Pride has come a long way since 1969, but it will always be rooted in
    showing up for equality, and fighting against hatred, violence, and police
    brutality. 


    Though many experience Pride month as an opportunity to celebrate their
    LGBTQ identities, we know that many LGBTQ young people struggle to feel
    Pride, and recent events have inspired deeper reflection this year. Trevor
    supports all individual expressions of Pride, this year and every year.


    The state of the world has increased uncertainty and anxiety for many LGBTQ
    youth. We know that these added stressors can exacerbate the unique
    challenges that LGBTQ young people already face, and can lead to negative
    mental health outcomes such as depression and thoughts of suicide.  From
    feelings of grief, anxiety, and fear, to stress related to isolation and
    physical distancing, our crisis services were there for LGBTQ youth,
    regardless of what was happening in the world.


    If you’d like to make a donation to support The Trevor Project’s work to end
    LGBTQ youth suicide — please click below. Our community of donors provides
    the stability for our expanding services that LGBTQ young people rely on
    each day. Your Pride gift will immediately go into action to connect young
    people directly to trained counselors — saving young lives.
