            With the help of our advocacy team, New York became the first state
            this year to protect LGBTQ youth from the discredited and dangerous
            practice of conversion therapy, making a total of 18 states to pass
            similar legislation. Massachusetts, Maine, and Colorado also passed
            legislation this year to protect LGBTQ youth from conversion therapy
            — making for a total of 4 states to do so this year in the U.S. We
            celebrated these victories in 2019 and we continue to build momentum
            to end conversion therapy by licensed practitioners among minors in
            all 50 states.

            The Trevor Project sent 100 copies of “A Day in the Life of Marlon
            Bundo,” an illustrated children’s book that explores topics of
            acceptance and marriage equality, to Immanuel Christian School,
            where it was reported that second lady Karen Pence would teach art.
            Our CEO & Executive Director, Amit Paley, said “We know that
            lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth from rejecting families are more
            than eight times more likely to attempt suicide than their straight
            peers. We hope Immanuel Christian School will adopt policies of
            inclusion for LGBTQ young people that make them feel safe, accepted,
            and loved.”

            Suicide prevention among young people is a growing concern across
            the country. Schools have a critical role and responsibility in
            identifying and providing interventions for students at risk for
            suicide ideation and behavior.


            Having effective suicide prevention policies is essential to meeting
            this responsibility. To support schools’ efforts, The Trevor Project
            with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the American
            School Counselor Association, and the National Association of School
            Psychologists have collaborated to update the Model School District
            Policy on Suicide Prevention, a comprehensive guidebook for school

            suicide prevention, intervention and postvention policies for K–12

    Thank you so much for supporting our work and keeping up-to-date — not to
    mention taking the time for this quiz! 


    We helped over 100,000 youth so far in 2019 but we know next year we’ll be
    able to reach even more young people. We had our biggest year yet in
    supporting LGBTQ youth on our lifeline, chat, and text services, as well as
    with our advocacy, research and education programs. These services are
    available because of our donors and supporters. 


    We estimate there are over 1.8 million LGBTQ youth who seriously consider
    suicide each year in the U.S. **Will you consider making a gift to make sure
    our services can grow in 2020?** Expanding our services means saving more
    young lives and we can’t do that without you:
