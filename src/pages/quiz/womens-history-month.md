    Women’s History Month gives us an opportunity to reflect and celebrate the
    women past and present who have helped shape our world. Their courage and
    conviction spurred political movements, social change, and advances in
    gender equity. While there’s plenty of work left to do, we’re grateful to
    the women who came before and continue to inspire us today.

        In 2019, New York City announced a monument honoring transgender people
        — the first in the world — to celebrate and commemorate two activists
        for their role in pioneering the modern fight for LGBTQ rights.

    Hope you had a great time learning more about some of the countless women
    who have transformed our world through their ingenuity, perseverance, and
    bravery. Women have won the right to vote, outpaced their male peers in
    college enrollment, and achieve new milestones each day. But we still have
    much work to do.


    Women still earn less for equal work. Women’s reproductive and civil rights
    are under legislative attack each day. And, women still face systemic
    discrimination and structural bias — [transgender and nonbinary people
    experience these inequities at disproportionately higher
    rates](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/trvr_press/new-poll-details-impact-of-covid-19-and-recent-violence-against-black-americans-on-youth-mental-health/).


    Together, we can continue to advance progress by changing discourse,
    policies, and perception. Consider making a donation to support The Trevor
    Project’s work to support LGBTQ youth. Our community of donors provides the
    stability for our expanding services that LGBTQ young people rely on each
    day.
