            Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson will be the honorees of the

            With the combination of her championship wins and lucrative
            endorsements, Osaka overtook her idol, Serena Williams, to claim the
            title as the highest-paid female athlete in a single year. She
            started playing tennis at the age of 3 and went pro a month before
            her 16th birthday in 2014. In the year that followed, she became the
            first Japanese player to win a Slam and the first Asian tennis
            player ever to be ranked Number 1 in the world. Outspoken and
            fearless, she’s poised to become a once-in-a-generation athlete.

            opponent making her Delaware’s first out LGBTQ person elected to the

            person to speak at a major party convention when she addressed the
            Democratic National Convention in 2016 and as the first out
            transgender White House staffer as an intern for the Obama White

    Hope you had a great time learning more about some of the countless women
    who have transformed our world through their ingenuity, perseverance, and
    bravery. Women have won the right to vote, outpace their male peers in
    college enrollment, and achieve new milestones each day. But we still have
    much work to do.


    Women still earn less for equal work. Women’s reproductive and civil rights
    are under legislative attack each day. And, women still face systemic
    discrimination and structural bias — [transgender and nonbinary people
    experience these inequities at disproportionately higher
    rates](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/trvr_press/new-poll-details-impact-of-covid-19-and-recent-violence-against-black-americans-on-youth-mental-health/).


    Together, we can continue to advance progress by changing discourse,
    policies, and perception. Consider making a donation to support The Trevor
    Project’s work to support LGBTQ youth. Our community of donors provides the
    stability for our expanding services that LGBTQ young people rely on each
    day.
