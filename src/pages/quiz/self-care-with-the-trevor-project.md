            Sleep helps our mind reset after the day is over. Many functions are
            affected by the amount of sleep we get — learning, memory, stamina,
            general health, and even mood. That’s why sleep is not only
            necessary for our bodily functions but also a great way to help with
            self care.

            Anything that makes you feel better is self care. Self care is about
            identifying what you enjoy, and introducing those activities into
            your daily life. It’s important to find activities that you can do
            indoors or alone, which can be protective factors for your mental

            The public health crisis caused by COVID-19 is causing uncertainty
            and stress for people of all ages and identities. For LGBTQ young
            people who are already at greater risk of anxiety, depression, and
            negative health outcomes, the coronavirus can exacerbate the
            challenges they already face. The social distancing and isolation
            necessary to stop the spread of the virus can also increase the
            feelings of loneliness and need for support that so many LGBTQ youth
            experience.


            At times like this it is more important than ever to ensure The
            Trevor Project’s life-saving services are available 24/7. All our
            programs — especially our phone, text, and chat crisis services —
            are continuing to support young people during this time. 


            We want to encourage you to check in with the LGBTQ youth in your
            lives. If they feel hopeless, alone, or have thoughts of suicide,
            please encourage them to visit TheTrevorProject.org/Help to access
            Trevor counselors on the phone, chat, or text. 


            If you sense they’re looking for social interaction, please tell
            them about TrevorSpace.org, our safe space social networking site
            for LGBTQ youth.
