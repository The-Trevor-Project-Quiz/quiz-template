            With the help of our advocacy team, New York became the first state
            this year to protect LGBTQ youth from the discredited and dangerous
            practice of conversion therapy, making a total of 18 states to pass
            similar legislation. Massachusetts, Maine, and Colorado also passed
            legislation this year to protect LGBTQ youth from conversion therapy
            — making for a total of 4 states to do so this year in the U.S. We
            celebrated these victories in 2019 and we continue to build momentum
            to end conversion therapy by licensed practitioners among minors in
            all 50 states.

    Thank you so much for supporting our work and keeping up-to-date — not to
    mention taking the time for this quiz! 


    We helped over 100,000 youth so far in 2019 but we know next year we’ll be
    able to reach even more young people. We had our biggest year yet in
    supporting LGBTQ youth on our lifeline, chat, and text services, as well as
    with our advocacy, research and education programs. These services are
    available because of our donors and supporters. 


    We estimate there are over 1.8 million LGBTQ youth who seriously consider
    suicide each year in the U.S. **Will you consider making a gift to make sure
    our services can grow in 2020?** Expanding our services means saving more
    young lives and we can’t do that without you:
